# Discord-Channel-Changer

Little external app I am trying to create that allows you to change channels with a hotkey

I am hopeful this can help with games like Star Citizen to allow you to hit a hotkey setup with the app to change channels in a setup discord server. This will allow discord to work more like a radio until Star Citizen develops better in game comms. This requires a discord bot to be setup with permissions to change users channels.
